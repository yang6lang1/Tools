CMPT 307 Project Part A:
(My implementation of two-three tree does not allow duplicate values to be inserted. However, all other functionalities are the same.)

All the source code files are in CMPTAssignmnt/src/dataStructure
-	ITree.java : Tree interface
-	Node.java: Tree node class
-	Leaf.java: Tree leaf class
-	TwoThreeTree.java: Implementation of the two-three tree
-	TextReader: helper class to read input from a file
* -	TreeTestCases.java: The program that runs the tree operations *

To run the program:
1. Unzip the archive file "CMPTAssignment"
2. Open eclipse
3. In Project Explorer window, right click and click the "Import..." from the context menu.
4. In the import window, click "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace" -> "Next"
5. Browse to the directory where the project is unzipped
6. Import the unzipped project "CMPTAssignment" and click finish
7. In Project Explorer window, expand the project -> src -> dataStructure
8. Right click on "TreeTestCases.java" class and click "Run As" -> "Java Application"
9. Open "0959.txt" and you will see the output

* Make modifications in input.txt and run in the same way, the 0959.txt will be updated
* I also displayed the debug information in console in case you are interested in each step of the program.

Thanks! :)
