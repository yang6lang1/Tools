	describe project: overview, detail, involvement, problems, solution, talk about the project from beginning to end, improvement, what you learned
	why working for Facebook, from an engineering point of view: interested in Facebook technology

- Ask Questions
	See if you can ask questions to narrow down the problems

- Others
	coding, algorithm questions in my best language, design patterns, and more specific questions to your background
	data structures, binary trees, linked lists, object oriented analysis/design
	ASK GOOD QUESTIONS AT THE END

Interview Questions
************************************************************
Difference between Java and C++
1. Java doesn't have pointers, it uses reference
2. Java does not allow multiple class inheritance while C++ does.
3. Java runs in a virtual machine. C++ compiles the code into assembly language
4. C++ natively supports unsigned algorithm
5. In Java, parameters are always pass by value. In C++, parameters can be passed by value, reference, pointer
6. Java has built-in garbage collection
7. C++ allows operator overloading. Java only allows method overloading.


************************************************************
Array & String:
************************************************************
1. Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
-	approach1: sort both strings O(nlogn)
-	approach2: traverse both strings to get an array of character count
* learned int array initialization: cannot use term " int[] a1,a2 = new int[256] " => "int[] a1 = new int[256], a2 = new int[256]"

2. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20
* learned that Java does not support c style string(null-terminated string)

3. NxN matrix, each pixel is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
* approach the problem systematically. think about the reason why each variable is used.

4. Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0
* be careful that all the matrix will become 0 if you set 0 while traversing!
-	approach, keep track which row and which col contains 0 after first round of traversing, and then set
-	use int[] or HashSet <- this is better

5. Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one work is a substring of another. Given two strings, 
s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring 
("waterbottle", "erbottlewat")
-	approach: concatenate s1 with itself, use the function call to check if s2 is a substring of the string
* think outside of the box!!!

************************************************************
Linked Lists
************************************************************
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
How to do this if temporary buffer is not allowed?
