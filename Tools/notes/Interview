Facebook suggestions
************************************
1. Add one more sharing option for posts & photos: private (requires a customized password everytime)
	- problem: integration with instagram
	- problem: local photo cache
2. Browsing the old photos sometimes crash, improve the compress and extract function
3. Implement a delete and recovery machenism for photos & posts

Describe yourself
************************************
- last year of computer engineering, graduate Spring 2016
- consider myself a software guy
- finished 16-month of coop in 2 different companies, (ZE PowerGroup Inc, SAP)
  ZE: online analytical tool, Junior Application Developer
  SAP: Corey team, Lumira Server build, extension manager, P&R...
- passionate about technology, specifically cloud technology, machine learning, OpenGL computer graphics
- strong self-starter: 
	To improve technical skills and problem solving skills, take online coruses (Coursera, MITOCW), 
			attend case competition and hackathons
	I worked on two side projects, 2D games developed in Java 
- I am technical but comfortable about communicating with other people
	as an engineering student, most of my projects are team based, comfortable working in a team
	In SAP, I was selected to be the Intern Career Development committee co-chair of the
	organize events such as Speed Networking, Career Workshop, Coffee Corners for other interns
	presented the status to the SAP Vancouver Executive Leader Team (ELT)
	I find that experience very enjoyable and beneficial to me

************************************
Why Facebook?
************************************
passionate about machine learing. This semester, I am taking online coursera course offered Andrew Ng from Stanford University. Used a lot in Facebook.
Facebook organizes internal Hackathons every two weeks. I have joined a Microsoft Hackathon last year with my friend and implemented....I find the fast-pace environment very enjoyable because I become very productive when there's a specific goal and a time constraint
I have been in SAP for 8 months and their development process is very mature. It is professional and requires a lot of cross-team communication on the daily basis. It is professional and effective but it is kinda slow and I find myself not particularly suitable for that. Sometimes it takes way too long for the code to get into code base. Facebook is well-known for its fast-pace development environment. So I hope I have the opportunity to experience this culture.

************************************
Field of interest?
************************************
I find myself very facinated by machine learning technology. the way it uses calculus and linear algebra to train the neuron network.
I enjoy game development (game is an integration of a lot of technologies)including the use of physics libraries, game logic design when data structures are involved, game rendering that uses computer graphics technology. 
UI automation testing. Back-end product build experience with Maven. Implemented server-side function in Java

************************************

************************************
Side project
************************************
I have worked on 2 side projects so far, both are Java 2D games that run on desktop and both are rendered using Java Swing.
The first one is a customizable pinball game called Gizmoball, which is inspired by a course project of MIT OCW. 
I worked on this project individually for four months and learned a lot of stuff, such as how to build application 
interface using Java Swing, OOP, basic collision detections, and also the basics of XML because I implemented an 
XML parser and reader to save and load the game configurations. Unfortunately, the game was pretty buggy and I 
didn't realize what I did wrong until the late stage of the development. I figured out the problem after doing 
a lot of research and realized it is a bad idea to track the game objects using their pixel positions because 
pixels are always integers, it is almost inevitable to have tunneling effect if the object moves too fast. 
I did my research, and that brought me into my second side project.

I would like to describe my second side project mentioned on my Resume, Blockadia, is a game engine. The user 
can use this game engine to quickly create their own 2d games. It has a framework that supports user to implement 
save/load, zoom in/out in the virtual game world, physics simulation (JBox2D) and rendering using Java Swing.
In this project, I worked with a friend and used GitHub to manage the code, branches and bugs of the project. 
My friend took charge of the user interface I was working on the game back-end including simple frame-based 
sprite animation, collision handling, user input handling and the 2D viewport camera with the ability of
zooming in/out and dragging to move the view. I have finished creating a spaceship demo game using my game engine 
and I can show you if u are interested. From this project, I got a lot of practice on OOP and became more 
proficient with the use of some more advanced Java features such as generics, abstract class, input listeners 
in Java Swing because they are used everywhere. This project also get me exposed to many new technologies such 
as OpenGL rendering and game AI development. It made me realize how many things I want to learn. 
I became very interested in things like Thread programming, Networking topics(TCP, UDP),  
and game graphics rendering. I started learning OpenGL because of this.

************************************
Most difficult problem
************************************
Metalslug one-way stair

************************************
Heavy workflow and how did you solve it
************************************
	this can be avoided by effective planning and communication
	- learn how to prioritize the work based on team's value, and my own ability
	- whenever i was overloaded with work, i will tell the team and manager right away
	- if the task can only be done by me. split into subtasks and finish the important ones

************************************
Conflict with others
************************************
i know how to stay out of trouble.
case competition
-	resolve conflicts
-	work hard myself
-	show appreciation to other ppl's work
-	don't be too attached to the idea

************************************
Questions to the interviewer
************************************
-	Facebook's development cycle. how long? daily scrum?
-	What collaboration tool does Facebook use? Git? Code review process?
-	How are tasks assigned to different members? do engineers pick themselves? or assigned by feature leads? are their designated testing teams or everyone do testing? How are co-ops or new hires selected for team?
-	Generally, how big is each team? What is the general composition of each team?
-	Do you run into the kind of situation that your team's work is blocked by other teams? How did you solve it?

-	next step?

************************************
Finish
************************************
Thank you again for calling. It was a pleasure talking to you. I really enjoyed the conversation and I hope we have opportunity to work together. Have a good day!

-	thank you note to interviewers/HR
